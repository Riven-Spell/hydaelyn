**On a high level, as a user, server owner, bot administrator, or developer of the bot, what is the feature you want?**
e.g. As a user, I'd like to have a poll function on the bot. | As a bot administrator I'd like to see logs better separated by interaction.

**How would this improve the bot in your opinion?**
e.g. It would make it easier to decide what content to prog next. | It would make debugging in prod easier.

**How would you envision the feature/improvement working?**
e.g. poll responses would be handled with emotes, and polls would have a timeout. | Grepping over the interaction ID would also provide logs regarding database interactions and such.
